In Islamic tradition, the Ghul is classified as a type of **jinn** - a being created from smokeless fire with free will, but one that has chosen evil. The creature is capable of shape-shifting, often appearing as a beautiful woman (*Ghula*) to lure victims, or manifesting in demonic, terrifying form. Ghuls inhabit desolate places - graveyards, ruins, and desert wildernesses - and are known to ambush travelers, lead them astray, and devour them."
