## Overview

The **Ghul** (Arabic: غول, *ghūl*) is a demon or monster from Arabic and Islamic tradition, known for dwelling in graveyards, luring travelers in the desert, and consuming corpses and human flesh.

In Islamic tradition, the Ghul is classified as a type of **jinn** - a being created from smokeless fire with free will, but one that has chosen evil. The creature is capable of shape-shifting, often appearing as a beautiful woman (*Ghula*) to lure victims, or manifesting in demonic, terrifying form.

Ghuls inhabit desolate places - graveyards, ruins, and desert wildernesses - and are known to ambush travelers, lead them astray, and devour them.
